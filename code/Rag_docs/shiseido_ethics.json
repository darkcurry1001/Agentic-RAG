  "report": "Shiseido Company, Limited, a major player in the global skincare and cosmetics industry, has faced scrutiny regarding its ethical practices, particularly in animal testing, labor conditions, and corporate transparency. On the issue of animal testing, Shiseido states on its official website (https://www.shiseidogroup.com/sustainability/) that it adheres to the ban on animal testing for cosmetics in the EU and other regions where such laws exist. However, the company acknowledges that it may still conduct animal testing where required by law, such as in mainland China, where post-market animal testing is mandated for certain imported cosmetics. Due to this, Shiseido is not listed as cruelty-free by PETA, Cruelty Free Kitty, or Leaping Bunny. Independent organizations like Cruelty Free Kitty explicitly exclude Shiseido from their cruelty-free lists due to its compliance with Chinese regulations. Regarding labor conditions, Shiseido publishes annual sustainability reports outlining its commitment to fair labor practices, diversity, and employee well-being. The company is a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), which promotes ethical supply chain standards. However, independent audits or reports from labor rights organizations on Shiseido’s manufacturing facilities are limited. Transparency initiatives include Shiseido’s participation in the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) for environmental reporting and its alignment with the UN Global Compact principles. Despite these efforts, some critics argue that the company could improve supply chain transparency, particularly in sourcing ingredients like mica, which has been linked to child labor in other industries. Shiseido’s corporate ethics statements are publicly available, but third-party verification of its claims remains inconsistent. For consumers seeking cruelty-free alternatives, brands under Shiseido’s umbrella (such as NARS and Drunk Elephant) also face similar ethical dilemmas due to the parent company’s policies."
