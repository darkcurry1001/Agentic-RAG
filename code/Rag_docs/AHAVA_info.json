The brand is known for its cosmetics and therapeutic offerings, leveraging the unique properties of the Dead Sea. AHAVA was acquired by Fosun International, a Chinese multinational conglomerate, in 2016. Fosun International, listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX: 0656), operates across healthcare, tourism, fashion, and finance, among other sectors. AHAVA's headquarters are located in Tel Aviv, Israel, specifically at 12 Abba Hillel Silver Road, Ramat Gan. The company's primary production facility is situated in Mitzpe Ramon, near the Dead Sea, where it sources and processes minerals for its product lines. AHAVA employs approximately 200-300 workers, including researchers, production staff, and administrative personnel. The company markets its products globally, with significant distribution in North America, Europe, and Asia. Fosun International holds full ownership of AHAVA, as confirmed in its annual reports and corporate disclosures. Independent sources, such as financial filings and industry reports, corroborate Fosun's ownership structure. AHAVA's operations adhere to Israeli regulatory standards, and its production processes emphasize sustainability due to the ecological sensitivity of the Dead Sea region.
