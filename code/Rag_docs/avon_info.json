Natura &Co acquired Avon in 2020, merging it with its other beauty brands, including The Body Shop and Aesop, though Aesop was later sold to L'Oréal in 2023. Avon's headquarters is located in London, United Kingdom, specifically at Building 6, Chiswick Park, 566 Chiswick High Road, London W4 5HR. This location serves as the central hub for the company's global operations. Avon operates in numerous countries worldwide, with a significant presence in regions such as Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The company employs approximately 20,000 people globally, as reported in Natura &Co's 2022 annual report. Avon's production facilities are spread across multiple countries, including Poland, Brazil, and China. The company's manufacturing plant in Suwalki, Poland, is one of its largest, producing cosmetics for the European market. In Brazil, Avon leverages Natura &Co's existing infrastructure for production and distribution. Avon operates primarily through a direct-selling model, relying on a network of independent representatives to sell its products. This model has been a hallmark of Avon's business strategy for decades. Natura &Co, the parent company, is publicly traded on the São Paulo Stock Exchange under the ticker NATU3 and on the New York Stock Exchange under NTCO. Major shareholders of Natura &Co include investment firms, institutional investors, and individual stakeholders, with details available in the company's annual reports and regulatory filings.
