  "report": "Mixa is a French skincare brand specializing in dermatologically tested products for sensitive skin. It was acquired by L'Oréal, the global cosmetics giant, in 2021. Mixa operates as part of L'Oréal's Active Cosmetics Division, which focuses on dermatological and pharmacy-exclusive skincare brands. The company’s headquarters are located in France, though the exact address is not publicly specified in independent sources. L'Oréal’s corporate headquarters are in Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine, France, and it is likely that Mixa’s operations are integrated within this structure. Mixa products are manufactured in L'Oréal’s production facilities, which are spread across multiple countries, including France, Belgium, and the United States. However, Mixa does not disclose specific production sites for its products. As a subsidiary, Mixa benefits from L'Oréal’s extensive R&D and manufacturing infrastructure. L'Oréal employs over 88,000 people worldwide (as per their 2022 annual report), but Mixa’s specific workforce size is not publicly detailed. Shareholders of Mixa are effectively the shareholders of L'Oréal, as it is a fully owned subsidiary. L'Oréal’s major shareholders include the Bettencourt Meyers family (holding around 34% of shares), Nestlé (around 20% historically, though this has fluctuated), and institutional investors. Independent verification of Mixa’s operational specifics is limited, as L'Oréal typically reports financial and employment data at a group level rather than for individual brands. For further details, L'Oréal’s annual reports (available on their official website) and regulatory filings provide high-level insights, but brand-specific data for Mixa remains scarce in public domains.
