  "report": "Lumene is a Finnish skincare and cosmetics brand that emphasizes natural, sustainably sourced ingredients, primarily from the Nordic region. The company has publicly committed to ethical practices, including a strict no-animal-testing policy. Lumene states on its official website that it does not test its products on animals and does not sell in markets where animal testing is required by law (such as mainland China). This aligns with the EU ban on animal testing for cosmetics, which has been in place since 2013. Independent verification from Cruelty-Free Kitty confirms that Lumene is certified cruelty-free, though it does not currently hold certification from Leaping Bunny or PETA’s Beauty Without Bunnies program. However, Lumene’s absence from these lists does not necessarily indicate non-compliance, as some brands choose not to pursue additional certifications despite meeting cruelty-free standards. Regarding labor conditions, Lumene operates under Finnish and EU labor laws, which enforce fair wages, safe working conditions, and workers' rights. The company has not been linked to any major labor violations, though detailed third-party audits of its supply chain are not publicly available. Lumene emphasizes sustainability in its corporate communications, including efforts to reduce carbon emissions and use recyclable packaging. However, the brand could improve transparency by publishing more detailed reports on its supply chain ethics, such as sourcing practices for raw materials like cloudberry and birch sap. Independent assessments from organizations like Ethical Consumer highlight Lumene’s strengths in natural ingredient sourcing but note room for improvement in full supply chain disclosure. While Lumene is not owned by a parent company with known ethical controversies (Verdane focuses on sustainable investments), increased transparency in corporate governance and environmental impact reporting would further strengthen its ethical standing. For further verification, Lumene’s cruelty-free claims can be cross-referenced with Cruelty-Free Kitty’s database, and its compliance with EU regulations is documented in official EU cosmetic safety reports (COSMOS)."
