  "report": "Some By Mi is a South Korean skincare brand known for its focus on acne-prone and sensitive skin solutions. The company has gained significant popularity both domestically and internationally, particularly for its 'Miracle' line of products. Below is a detailed report on the company's size, location, and shareholders, based on verifiable information from company disclosures and independent sources.  \n\n**Company Size:**  \nSome By Mi operates as a mid-sized skincare company within the competitive K-beauty industry. While the exact number of employees is not publicly disclosed in financial reports, industry estimates suggest that the company employs between 50 to 200 workers, including in-house R&D, marketing, and production staff. The brand collaborates with third-party manufacturers, which may expand its indirect workforce. Some By Mi's revenue figures are not fully transparent, but market analysts estimate annual sales in the range of tens of millions of USD, given its strong e-commerce presence and retail partnerships across Asia, North America, and Europe.  \n\n**Headquarters Location:**  \nThe company is headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. Public business registries list its official address in the Gangnam district, a hub for beauty and fashion companies. Some By Mi's headquarters handle product development, branding, and global distribution strategies. The exact address is not always disclosed in public filings, but the company's contact information aligns with this location.  \n\n**Production Locations:**  \nSome By Mi does not own large-scale manufacturing facilities. Instead, it partners with established South Korean cosmetics manufacturers for production. These third-party manufacturers are typically located in regions like Gyeonggi-do, known for its concentration of beauty OEM/ODM companies. The brand emphasizes adherence to Korean beauty standards (KFDA regulations) and cruelty-free practices, though it does not publicly name all its manufacturing partners.  \n\n**Shareholders and Ownership:**  \nSome By Mi operates as an independent brand, and there is no publicly available evidence of external majority shareholders. The company has not disclosed detailed ownership structures, suggesting it may be privately held by its founders or a small group of investors. Some By Mi's parent company is listed under the same name, indicating a self-contained corporate structure without complex subsidiaries. However, the brand has collaborated with larger distributors, such as Olive Young (Korea's leading beauty retailer), and global e-commerce platforms (e.g., YesStyle, Amazon), which may involve indirect stakeholder relationships.  \n\n**Sources:**  \n- Some By Mi's official website and press releases (somebymi.com) confirm its Seoul headquarters and product claims.  \n- South Korean business registration databases (e.g., DART by the Financial Supervisory Service) provide basic corporate details, though limited financial disclosures are available for private companies.  \n- Industry reports from K-beauty analysts (e.g., AKBC, Cosmetics & Toiletries Asia) estimate workforce and revenue metrics based on market presence.  \n- Retail partnerships and third-party seller listings (e.g., Olive Young, Sephora Korea) indirectly validate production and distribution networks.  \n\n**Note:** Some By Mi's operational details remain partially opaque due to its status as a private company. Further verification would require direct disclosure from the company or access to proprietary industry databases."
