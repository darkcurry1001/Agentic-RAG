    "report": "Beiersdorf, the German multinational company behind brands like Nivea, Eucerin, and La Prairie, has made significant commitments to environmental sustainability, which are outlined in its official reports and verified by independent sources. The company's sustainability strategy, 'Care Beyond Skin,' focuses on reducing its environmental footprint across its value chain, including climate action, sustainable packaging, and responsible sourcing. Climate Action: Beiersdorf has set ambitious climate targets aligned with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The company aims to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30% by 2025 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. As of its 2022 Sustainability Report, Beiersdorf reduced its carbon emissions from operations by 64% compared to 2018, primarily through energy efficiency measures and renewable energy adoption. The company sources 100% renewable electricity for its production sites in Europe and has expanded this initiative globally. Independent verification by CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) awarded Beiersdorf an 'A-' score for climate change mitigation in 2022, reflecting its transparency and action. Sustainable Packaging: Beiersdorf has committed to making 100% of its packaging reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2025. As of 2022, 89% of its packaging met these criteria. The company has also reduced plastic use by introducing refill systems and lightweight packaging, such as the Nivea Naturally Good face care line, which uses 50% less plastic. Beiersdorf collaborates with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to advance circular economy principles. Water Stewardship: The company has reduced water consumption in its production processes by 35% since 2014, implementing water-saving technologies and recycling systems. Beiersdorf is a member of the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) and has certified several sites, including its Hamburg factory, under the AWS Standard. Responsible Sourcing: Beiersdorf adheres to strict sourcing guidelines for raw materials, prioritizing certified sustainable ingredients. For example, 100% of its palm oil derivatives are RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil)-certified, and it sources organic shea butter through fair trade partnerships. The company has also committed to zero deforestation in its supply chain by 2025. Independent audits by organizations like Rainforest Alliance verify these claims. Challenges and Criticisms: Despite progress, Beiersdorf faces challenges, such as the environmental impact of its global supply chain and the carbon footprint of its product transportation. Greenpeace has criticized the company for not fully eliminating microplastics from all its products, though Beiersdorf plans to phase them out by 2025.
