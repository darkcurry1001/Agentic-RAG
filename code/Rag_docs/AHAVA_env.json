  "report": "AHAVA, an Israeli skincare brand owned by Fosun International, operates in an ecologically sensitive region near the Dead Sea, raising environmental concerns regarding resource extraction, sustainability, and corporate responsibility. The company sources minerals and mud from the Dead Sea, a shrinking body of water that has lost over a third of its surface area in recent decades due to climate change and industrial water diversion. AHAVA states on its official website (www.ahava.com) that it follows sustainable harvesting practices, extracting materials in compliance with Israeli environmental regulations. However, independent reports, including a 2020 study by the Environmental Protection Ministry of Israel, highlight concerns over the long-term impact of mineral extraction on the Dead Sea ecosystem. AHAVA’s primary production facility is located in Mitzpe Ramon, where it processes Dead Sea minerals. The company claims to use energy-efficient manufacturing processes and has implemented water recycling systems to reduce waste, though specific data on water usage and carbon emissions are not publicly disclosed. Fosun International, as a parent company, has committed to broader sustainability goals under its ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) framework, including a pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. However, AHAVA’s direct contributions to these targets remain unclear, as Fosun’s annual sustainability reports do not break down environmental performance by subsidiary. Critics, including the Israeli environmental NGO Adam Teva V’Din, argue that while AHAVA holds certifications such as ISO 22716 (Cosmetics Good Manufacturing Practices), it lacks third-party verification for ecological claims, such as 'sustainable sourcing.' Additionally, the Dead Sea Works, a major mineral extraction company in the region, has faced legal challenges over environmental damage, indirectly affecting perceptions of AHAVA’s supply chain. AHAVA has not been directly implicated in these cases but operates within the same regulatory and ecological context. In recent years, the brand has introduced limited eco-friendly packaging initiatives, such as reducing plastic use in some product lines, though comprehensive lifecycle assessments of its packaging are unavailable. For further verification, Fosun’s corporate sustainability reports (available at www.fosun.com) and Israeli government environmental assessments provide context, but greater transparency from AHAVA regarding its environmental footprint is needed to fully assess its impact."
