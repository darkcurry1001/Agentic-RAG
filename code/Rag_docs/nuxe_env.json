  "report": "Nuxe, a French skincare and cosmetics brand, has implemented several environmental initiatives, though its overall sustainability profile remains mixed. The company emphasizes eco-conscious packaging, with commitments to reduce plastic waste. Since 2019, Nuxe has transitioned to using 100% recycled and recyclable glass for its iconic Huile Prodigieuse bottles, reducing its carbon footprint in packaging. Additionally, the brand has incorporated recycled plastic (rPET) for certain product lines and eliminated unnecessary secondary packaging. Nuxe has also partnered with EcoEmballages, a French recycling program, to encourage proper disposal of its products. However, the company still uses some non-recyclable components, such as certain pumps and caps, which limits full circularity. In terms of ingredient sourcing, Nuxe highlights its use of plant-based and organic ingredients, with some products certified by Ecocert (COSMOS standard). The brand claims to prioritize sustainable sourcing, including partnerships with fair-trade suppliers for key ingredients like argan oil. Despite these efforts, Nuxe does not publish a full environmental impact assessment or detailed carbon emissions data, making it difficult to independently verify its net ecological footprint. The company’s production facilities in France are subject to EU environmental regulations, but Nuxe has not disclosed whether its factories use renewable energy or have achieved carbon neutrality. Independent assessments, such as those by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), rate some Nuxe products moderately for environmental safety, though concerns remain about certain synthetic preservatives. Nuxe has not yet committed to global sustainability certifications like B Corp or joined industry-wide climate pledges such as the SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative).
