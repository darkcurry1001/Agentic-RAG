  "report": "Beiersdorf, the German multinational company behind brands like Nivea, Eucerin, and La Prairie, has a long-standing presence in the skincare industry. The company’s ethical practices have been scrutinized in several areas, including animal testing, labor conditions, and corporate transparency. This report compiles verified information from both company sources and independent assessments. **Animal Testing:** Beiersdorf states on its official website that it does not conduct animal testing for its cosmetic products, except where required by law (e.g., in China, where regulatory authorities may require animal testing for certain products). The company emphasizes its commitment to alternative testing methods and supports the global ban on cosmetic animal testing. Beiersdorf is not listed as a certified cruelty-free brand by PETA or the Leaping Bunny program, as its compliance with Chinese regulations means some products may still be subject to animal testing in specific markets. However, the company is a member of the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA), reflecting its investment in non-animal research methods. **Labor Conditions:** Beiersdorf adheres to international labor standards and is a member of the United Nations Global Compact, committing to fair labor practices, human rights, and anti-corruption measures. The company’s 2022 Sustainability Report highlights initiatives to ensure safe working conditions, fair wages, and employee development programs across its supply chain. Independent audits, such as those by the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA), have been conducted for some of Beiersdorf’s suppliers, though comprehensive public data on all suppliers is limited. Reports from organizations like the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre have not flagged major labor violations, but transparency regarding subcontractors remains an area for improvement. **Corporate Transparency:** Beiersdorf publishes annual sustainability reports detailing its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. The company has received recognition for its transparency, including a 'B' rating from CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) for climate change disclosure. However, critics argue that Beiersdorf could provide more granular data on its supply chain, particularly concerning raw material sourcing (e.g., palm oil, which is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)). Beiersdorf’s commitment to reducing CO2 emissions (aiming for carbon neutrality by 2025) and its use of recyclable packaging are noted as positive steps. **Independent Assessments:** While Beiersdorf is not listed by PETA or Leaping Bunny due to its presence in China, it has received praise for reducing animal testing reliance. The company’s ESG scores from agencies like MSCI (AA rating) and Sustainalytics (low-risk rating) reflect strong governance and moderate ethical performance. However, ongoing scrutiny is recommended, especially regarding supply chain transparency and market-specific animal testing policies.
