  "report": "Mixa, as part of L'Oréal's Active Cosmetics Division, operates under the environmental policies and sustainability commitments of its parent company. L'Oréal has made several public environmental commitments through its 'L'Oréal for the Future' program (2020), which sets targets for 2030. According to L'Oréal's 2022 Sustainability Report, the company has reduced its carbon emissions from operations by 81% (compared to 2005 baseline) while increasing production by 29%. However, these figures represent group-wide performance rather than Mixa-specific data. On water usage, L'Oréal reports a 44% reduction in water consumption per finished product since 2005 across all facilities. The company states that 100% of its industrial water waste is treated before release, though independent verification of this claim is limited. Packaging sustainability is a key focus, with L'Oréal claiming 88% of its packaging by volume is recyclable, refillable or compostable as of 2022. For Mixa specifically, some products feature eco-designed packaging with reduced plastic content, though comprehensive brand-level data isn't publicly available. In terms of biodiversity, L'Oréal has committed to ensuring 95% of its ingredients will be bio-based, derived from abundant minerals or circular processes by 2030. Currently, 59% meet this standard (2022 data). The company sources some ingredients through sustainable agriculture programs, including 100% RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil derivatives since 2020. Independent assessments by CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) give L'Oréal an 'A-' score for climate change (2022), placing it in the leadership category. However, environmental groups like Greenpeace have criticized the cosmetics industry's overall plastic footprint, noting that recyclability claims don't necessarily reflect real-world recycling rates. Mixa's environmental performance is largely subsumed within L'Oréal's reporting, making brand-specific impacts difficult to assess. While L'Oréal's science-based targets (approved by SBTi) and renewable energy investments (100% renewable electricity at all sites since 2021) suggest strong corporate policies, the lack of brand-level transparency makes independent verification of Mixa's environmental footprint challenging.
