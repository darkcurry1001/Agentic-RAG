  "report": "Peter Thomas Roth is a well-known skincare company specializing in clinical-grade products. The company was founded by Peter Thomas Roth himself in 1993 and operates as an independent entity without a publicly listed parent company. The brand is recognized for its innovative formulations and high-performance skincare solutions, often featuring scientifically backed ingredients.  Headquarters Location: Peter Thomas Roth is headquartered in New York, USA. The exact address is not publicly disclosed on their official website or in widely available corporate registries, but the company’s operations and executive offices are confirmed to be based in New York City. This aligns with the brand’s image as a premium skincare line rooted in a major cosmopolitan hub.  Production Locations: The company does not publicly disclose specific manufacturing facilities. However, industry standards suggest that Peter Thomas Roth products are likely produced in third-party contract manufacturing facilities, which is common for skincare brands of this scale. Some sources indicate that production may occur in the USA and possibly internationally, but this cannot be independently verified without official statements from the company.  Company Size and Workforce: Peter Thomas Roth does not publish detailed employee counts. Estimates based on similar-sized skincare companies suggest the workforce could range between 50-200 employees, encompassing roles in product development, marketing, sales, and operations. The company’s LinkedIn profile provides limited insights, listing a modest number of employees but without precise figures.  Shareholders and Ownership: Peter Thomas Roth remains a privately held company, with founder Peter Thomas Roth likely retaining significant or full ownership. There is no evidence of external shareholders or venture capital involvement in publicly available records. The lack of SEC filings or corporate disclosures suggests the company has not sought outside investment or gone public.  Independent Verification: While the company’s official website (peterthomasroth.com) emphasizes its product lineup and brand story, it does not provide granular corporate details. Independent databases like Crunchbase and Hoovers list the company as privately held with minimal financial or structural data. Retail partners (e.g., Sephora, Ulta) and press releases often highlight product collaborations but do not shed light on corporate specifics.  Challenges in Verification: The primary challenge in compiling this report is the limited transparency common among privately held skincare brands. Unlike publicly traded companies, Peter Thomas Roth is not obligated to disclose operational details, making it difficult to confirm production sites, employee counts, or ownership structure beyond reasonable inference.  Conclusion: Peter Thomas Roth operates as a privately owned skincare company headquartered in New York, with production likely outsourced to third-party manufacturers. The company’s workforce size and exact facilities remain undisclosed, but its market presence suggests a mid-sized operation focused on premium skincare distribution through major retailers and direct channels. For further details, official statements from the company or regulatory filings (if applicable) would be required."
