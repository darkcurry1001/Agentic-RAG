  "report": "AHAVA, an Israeli skincare brand owned by Chinese conglomerate Fosun International, has faced scrutiny over its ethical practices, particularly regarding animal testing, labor conditions, and corporate transparency. **Animal Testing**: AHAVA claims on its official website (www.ahava.com) that it does not conduct animal testing on its products, adhering to the EU’s ban on cosmetic animal testing. However, the company is not certified by Leaping Bunny or PETA’s Beauty Without Bunnies program, which require stricter supply-chain audits. Cruelty-Free Kitty, an independent watchdog, lists AHAVA as 'not cruelty-free' due to its sales in China, where animal testing may be required by law for imported cosmetics. Fosun International’s ownership further complicates this issue, as China’s pre-market animal testing laws (though relaxed since 2021) still pose ethical concerns for brands distributed there. **Labor Conditions**: AHAVA’s production facility is located in Mitzpe Ramon, Israel, where it employs approximately 200–300 workers. While the company states it adheres to fair labor practices, there is limited independent auditing of working conditions. Fosun International, as the parent company, publishes annual ESG reports (available at www.fosun.com) claiming compliance with international labor standards, but these lack subsidiary-specific data. Reports from Israeli labor rights groups, such as Kav LaOved, have not flagged major violations at AHAVA, but transparency remains limited. **Corporate Transparency**: AHAVA discloses little about its supply chain beyond asserting ethical sourcing of Dead Sea minerals. Independent investigations, including a 2020 report by the Israeli environmental NGO Adam Teva V’Din, raised concerns about the ecological and ethical implications of mineral extraction in the Dead Sea region, though AHAVA itself has not been directly implicated. Fosun’s opaque corporate structure—a common critique in financial analyses by Bloomberg and Reuters—further clouds accountability. **Certifications**: AHAVA holds ISO 22716 (cosmetics GMP) certification, but its absence from Leaping Bunny, PETA, and other cruelty-free registries undermines its ethical claims. The brand’s lack of Fair Trade or B Corp certification also contrasts with competitors who emphasize social responsibility. In summary, while AHAVA avoids public controversies, its ethical standing is hampered by indirect ties to animal testing (via China sales), limited labor disclosures, and reliance on parent-company narratives rather than independent verification."
