  "report": "Avon, a subsidiary of Natura &Co, has a long-standing history in the cosmetics industry, and its ethical practices have been scrutinized by various organizations. Regarding animal testing, Avon states on its official website (www.avon.com) that it does not test its products on animals and is committed to cruelty-free beauty. However, Avon sells products in mainland China, where animal testing may be required by law for certain cosmetics. This has led to mixed perceptions of its cruelty-free status. PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) lists Avon as a company that 'does not test on animals' but notes that its products may still be subject to animal testing in China due to regulatory requirements. Cruelty Free Kitty, another independent watchdog, does not classify Avon as a fully cruelty-free brand because of its sales in China. Avon is not listed by Leaping Bunny, a rigorous certification program that requires brands to meet strict no-animal-testing criteria globally, including in China. On labor conditions, Avon operates in multiple countries and relies heavily on a direct-selling workforce composed of independent representatives. While the company promotes entrepreneurship and flexible work opportunities, some reports have raised concerns about low earnings and lack of benefits for these representatives. Natura &Co, Avon's parent company, publishes annual sustainability reports detailing efforts to improve labor conditions across its supply chain. These reports are available on Natura &Co's investor relations page (www.naturaeco.com/investors). Regarding corporate transparency, Natura &Co has been recognized for its sustainability initiatives, including commitments to reducing environmental impact and promoting fair trade practices. However, Avon itself has faced criticism in the past for opaque compensation structures for its sales representatives. Independent sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters have covered Natura &Co's broader ethical commitments, but specific investigations into Avon's labor practices remain limited. In summary, while Avon promotes a cruelty-free stance, its presence in China complicates its ethical standing on animal testing. Labor conditions for its salesforce have been questioned, though Natura &Co's broader sustainability efforts provide some reassurance. Greater transparency on Avon's direct-selling model and clearer commitments to avoiding animal testing in all markets would strengthen its ethical profile."
