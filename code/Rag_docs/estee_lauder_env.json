  "report": "The Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) has made public commitments to environmental sustainability, though its progress and practices face scrutiny from independent observers. The company released an ambitious 2023 Sustainability Report outlining goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030 and 100% renewable energy for its direct operations by 2025. As of 2023, ELC reports that 72% of its electricity comes from renewable sources, with solar installations at facilities in Belgium and the U.S. The company has reduced its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 52% since 2018 (base year), according to its CDP Climate Change submission. However, Scope 3 emissions (which account for ~90% of its carbon footprint) remain challenging, growing 18% since 2018 due to increased production and transportation. Packaging sustainability has been a focus area, with ELC claiming 78% of its packaging is now recyclable, refillable, reusable, or recycled. Notable initiatives include MAC Cosmetics' Back-to-MAC recycling program and Aveda's use of 100% post-consumer recycled materials for packaging. However, a 2023 report by the Changing Markets Foundation criticized ELC for still using excessive secondary packaging and non-recyclable components in some product lines. Water stewardship efforts include a 35% reduction in water intensity per unit of production since 2015, though the company's water replenishment projects only offset 12% of its operational water use. ELC sources several high-impact ingredients like palm oil (12,000 metric tons annually) and mica, with 100% RSPO-certified palm oil since 2021 and membership in the Responsible Mica Initiative. Independent audits by Rainforest Action Network have raised concerns about indirect sourcing risks in palm oil supply chains. The company's deforestation policy received a score of 72.5% from Forest 500 in 2023 - above average but with gaps in implementation reporting. ELC has faced criticism for continuing to use petroleum-derived ingredients in ~85% of its formulations, despite marketing 'clean beauty' lines. A 2022 investigation by the Environmental Working Group found 34% of Estée Lauder brand products contained potentially hazardous chemicals like parabens and synthetic fragrances. On biodiversity, ELC partners with the Amazon Sacred Headwaters Initiative and has committed to land conservation, though its actual impact remains unverified by third parties. The company scored a 'B' on CDP's 2023 Forests questionnaire for palm oil but failed to disclose for timber and cattle products.
