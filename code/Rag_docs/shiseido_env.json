  "report": "Shiseido Company, Limited has implemented several environmental initiatives aimed at reducing its ecological footprint, though its progress and commitments vary across different areas. The company outlines its sustainability goals in its annual 'Sustainability Report' and on its corporate website (https://www.shiseidogroup.com/sustainability/environment/). A key focus is reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with Shiseido committing to carbon neutrality by 2026 for its own operations and net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2040. As of its 2022 Sustainability Report, Shiseido reduced CO2 emissions from its direct operations (Scope 1 and 2) by approximately 54% compared to 2016 levels, largely through renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency measures at its manufacturing sites in Japan, Europe, and the Americas. However, independent assessments by CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) gave Shiseido a 'B' rating in 2022 for climate change efforts, indicating room for improvement compared to industry leaders. In water stewardship, Shiseido reports a 30% reduction in water usage per unit of production since 2016, with water recycling systems implemented at major factories like the Kakegawa Plant in Japan. The company has faced criticism from environmental groups for not joining the Ceres Investor Water Hub or disclosing full water risk assessments for all manufacturing locations. Packaging sustainability is another focus area, with Shiseido increasing its use of recycled materials (30% of plastic packaging in 2022) and aiming for 100% sustainable packaging by 2025. However, a 2021 report by the Environmental Investigation Agency noted that Shiseido, like many beauty companies, still relies heavily on single-use plastics without clear phase-out timelines. On deforestation-linked ingredients, Shiseido states that 100% of its palm oil derivatives are RSPO-certified, but the Rainforest Action Network's 2022 scorecard ranked the company as 'Middle of the Pack' for sustainable palm oil commitments. Biodiversity protection efforts include participation in the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), though concrete outcomes remain limited. Independent analysis by Sustainalytics gives Shiseido an 'Environmental Risk Rating' of 22.3 (medium risk), noting strengths in operational eco-efficiency but weaknesses in supply chain environmental management. The company has not yet aligned its climate targets with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) criteria as of 2023. While Shiseido's environmental reporting follows GRI Standards, some stakeholders have called for more detailed disclosure of Scope 3 emissions (which account for over 80% of its carbon footprint) and supplier audit results."
