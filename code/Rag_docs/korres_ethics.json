  "report": "Korres is a Greek skincare and cosmetics brand founded in 1996 by pharmacist George Korres. The company is known for its use of natural ingredients and commitment to ethical practices. **Animal Testing:** Korres has a firm stance against animal testing and claims to be a cruelty-free brand. The company states on its official website (korres.com) that it does not test its products or ingredients on animals, nor does it outsource such testing to third parties. Korres is certified by PETA’s Beauty Without Bunnies program, listed as cruelty-free, and does not sell in markets like mainland China where animal testing is required by law. However, Korres is **not** currently certified by Leaping Bunny, which has stricter requirements, including ongoing supplier monitoring. Independent sources such as Cruelty-Free Kitty (crueltyfreekitty.com) confirm Korres’ cruelty-free status but note the absence of Leaping Bunny certification. **Labor Conditions:** Korres emphasizes ethical sourcing and fair labor practices. The company manufactures its products in Greece, where labor laws align with EU regulations, ensuring minimum wage, safe working conditions, and workers’ rights. While Korres does not publish detailed supplier audits, its adherence to EU labor standards provides a baseline for ethical employment. There are no major public controversies or reports of labor violations associated with Korres. **Corporate Transparency:** Korres discloses its ingredient lists and sustainability efforts on its website, including its use of natural and organic components. However, the company does not provide extensive supply chain transparency reports or detailed environmental impact assessments, which limits full verification of its ethical claims. Korres highlights its commitment to sustainability through initiatives like recyclable packaging and reducing water waste, but independent third-party evaluations of these claims are scarce. **Certifications:** Korres is listed as cruelty-free by PETA and recognized by Cruelty-Free Kitty, but it lacks Leaping Bunny certification, which requires a more rigorous auditing process. The brand is also vegan-friendly for many products, though not all, as some formulations contain honey and yogurt. In summary, Korres maintains a strong ethical stance on animal welfare and complies with EU labor standards, but its transparency regarding supply chains and environmental impact could be improved. Independent verifications from PETA and Cruelty-Free Kitty support its cruelty-free claims, though the absence of Leaping Bunny certification may raise questions for some ethical consumers."
