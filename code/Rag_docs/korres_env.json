  "report": "Korres, the Greek skincare and cosmetics company founded in 1996, has implemented several environmental initiatives that align with its commitment to sustainability. The company emphasizes the use of natural ingredients, many of which are sourced locally in Greece, reducing the carbon footprint associated with long-distance transportation. Korres states on its official website (korres.com) that it prioritizes sustainable sourcing, with over 85% of its raw materials being of natural origin. The company also highlights its efforts to minimize environmental impact through responsible packaging. Korres has transitioned to using recyclable materials for its primary packaging, including glass bottles and aluminum tubes, and has reduced the use of plastic where possible. The brand claims that 100% of its paper packaging is FSC-certified, ensuring it comes from responsibly managed forests. In terms of production, Korres manufactures its products in Greece, adhering to EU environmental regulations, which include strict waste management and emissions controls. The company has implemented energy-saving measures in its facilities, though specific data on energy reduction or carbon emissions is not publicly disclosed. Korres has also introduced water-saving technologies in its production processes, though again, detailed metrics on water usage reduction are not available. The brand participates in the TerraCycle recycling program in certain markets, allowing customers to return empty product containers for proper recycling. However, Korres does not publish a comprehensive sustainability report, which limits the ability to independently verify all its environmental claims. Independent assessments, such as those by environmental watchdog groups, are scarce, making it difficult to fully evaluate the company's impact. While Korres has received recognition for its natural formulations and eco-friendly packaging efforts from beauty industry awards, it lacks third-party certifications like COSMOS Organic or Ecocert, which would provide additional validation of its environmental claims. In summary, Korres demonstrates a clear commitment to environmental sustainability through its use of natural ingredients, recyclable packaging, and adherence to EU production standards. However, the absence of detailed public reporting and third-party certifications means that some of its environmental claims remain unverified. For consumers seeking brands with strong environmental credentials, Korres presents a generally positive profile but could enhance transparency by publishing measurable sustainability goals and achievements."
