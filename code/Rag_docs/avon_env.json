  "report": "Avon, as part of Natura &Co, has made several environmental commitments that align with its parent company’s broader sustainability goals. Natura &Co is a certified B Corporation and has publicly pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, a commitment detailed in its 2022 Sustainability Report (available at www.naturaeco.com/sustainability). Avon’s environmental strategy focuses on three key areas: reducing carbon emissions, sustainable packaging, and responsible sourcing. In terms of carbon footprint, Avon has implemented energy efficiency measures in its manufacturing facilities, including its largest production plant in Suwalki, Poland, which uses renewable energy sources. According to Natura &Co’s 2022 report, Avon reduced its absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 13.5% compared to 2019 levels. However, the company still relies on third-party suppliers for some raw materials, and its Scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions from supply chains) remain a challenge. On sustainable packaging, Avon has committed to making 100% of its packaging recyclable, reusable, or compostable by 2025. As of 2022, the company reported that 85% of its packaging was already recyclable, with efforts underway to reduce plastic use and incorporate post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials. Independent assessments by organizations like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation have recognized Natura &Co for its circular economy initiatives, though Avon-specific progress is less frequently highlighted. Regarding sourcing, Avon follows Natura &Co’s ‘Commitment to Life’ policy, which emphasizes deforestation-free supply chains and the use of sustainably sourced ingredients. The company claims that 95% of its palm oil derivatives are RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) certified, as verified in its 2022 sustainability documentation. However, environmental NGOs like Greenpeace have criticized the broader cosmetics industry for insufficient transparency in sourcing practices, and Avon has not escaped such scrutiny entirely. Water usage is another critical area; Avon has reduced water consumption in its production processes by 20% since 2019, according to company reports. Despite these efforts, independent watchdogs like CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) have not rated Avon separately from Natura &Co, making it difficult to assess its standalone environmental performance. In conclusion, while Avon benefits from Natura &Co’s strong sustainability framework, its individual
