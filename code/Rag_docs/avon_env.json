  "report": "Avon, under its parent company Natura &Co, has made several environmental commitments and initiatives, which are documented in public reports and third-party assessments. Natura &Co, a global leader in cosmetics and beauty, has a strong sustainability agenda, and Avon’s operations are partially aligned with this vision. However, Avon’s environmental impact and initiatives are often reported under Natura &Co’s broader sustainability framework rather than as standalone efforts. Here’s a detailed overview of verifiable environmental information about Avon and its parent company: 1. **Carbon Emissions and Climate Goals**: Natura &Co has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with interim targets for 2030. The company is part of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and claims to have reduced its carbon footprint in recent years. Avon’s specific contributions to these goals are less detailed, but Natura &Co’s 2022 Sustainability Report highlights efforts to reduce emissions across all brands, including Avon. 2. **Sustainable Sourcing and Packaging**: Natura &Co emphasizes sustainable sourcing, including certified palm oil and recycled materials for packaging. Avon has introduced some products with reduced plastic packaging, though independent assessments (e.g., from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation) suggest room for improvement in circular economy practices. 3. **Deforestation and Biodiversity**: Natura &Co has a zero-deforestation policy for its supply chain, verified by organizations like the Forest Trust. Avon’s compliance with this policy is implied but not extensively documented in independent reports. 4. **Water Usage**: Avon’s water stewardship efforts are less prominently reported compared to Natura’s flagship brand. Natura &Co’s overall water reduction targets apply group-wide, but Avon’s specific performance data is sparse. 5. **Chemical Safety and Green Chemistry**: Avon has faced scrutiny in the past for certain chemical ingredients in its products. While Natura &Co promotes green chemistry, Avon’s transition to safer formulations is ongoing, with some progress noted in its removal of parabens and other controversial substances. 6. **Certifications and Partnerships**: Avon holds some certifications like Leaping Bunny (cruelty-free), but its environmental certifications (e.g., USDA Organic, Fair Trade) are limited compared to Natura’s brands. Natura &Co’s B Corp certification covers the entire group, including Avon. 7. **Waste Management**: Avon has implemented recycling programs in some markets, but comprehensive data on waste reduction is lacking. Natura &Co reports group-wide progress, but Avon’s specific metrics are not always disaggregated. 8. **Independent Criticism**: NGOs like Greenpeace have praised Natura &Co’s overall sustainability leadership but note that Avon lags behind in transparency and tangible environmental outcomes compared to Natura and The Body Shop.
