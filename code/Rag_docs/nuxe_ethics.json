  "report": "Nuxe is a French skincare brand known for its plant-based formulations and luxury beauty products. The company has publicly stated its commitment to ethical practices, including a no-animal-testing policy. Nuxe claims that its products are not tested on animals, in compliance with the European Union’s ban on animal testing for cosmetics (Regulation EC No 1223/2009). However, Nuxe is not certified by PETA’s Beauty Without Bunnies program, nor does it appear on Cruelty-Free Kitty’s list of approved brands. The company is also not listed as Leaping Bunny certified, which requires a rigorous audit of the supply chain to ensure no animal testing at any stage. This lack of third-party certification raises questions about the extent of Nuxe’s cruelty-free claims, particularly for markets like China, where animal testing may be required by law for certain imported cosmetics. Regarding labor conditions, Nuxe emphasizes fair employment practices and operates primarily in France, where labor laws are stringent. The company has not been linked to major labor scandals, but as a privately held, family-owned business, it discloses limited details about its supply chain or factory working conditions. Corporate transparency is moderate—Nuxe shares sustainability efforts on its website, such as eco-friendly packaging initiatives and responsible sourcing, but does not publish comprehensive ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reports. Independent audits or disclosures regarding ethical sourcing beyond EU regulatory requirements are not publicly available.
