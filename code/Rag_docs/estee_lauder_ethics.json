  "report": "The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (ELC) is a global leader in prestige beauty, but its ethical practices—particularly regarding animal testing, labor conditions, and corporate transparency—have been scrutinized. Below is a verified assessment of the company’s ethical commitments. **Animal Testing Policy**: Estée Lauder does not conduct animal testing on its products or ingredients except where required by law, such as in mainland China. The company states on its official website (2024) that it advocates for alternative testing methods and supports the global ban on animal testing. However, because some of its products are sold in China, where animal testing is mandatory for certain imported cosmetics, Estée Lauder is not considered fully cruelty-free by major animal rights organizations. PETA lists Estée Lauder as a company that 'does test on animals' due to its compliance with Chinese regulations. Cruelty Free Kitty and Leaping Bunny do not certify Estée Lauder or its brands as cruelty-free, as they require brands to avoid markets with mandatory animal testing. **Labor Conditions**: Estée Lauder’s Supplier Code of Conduct (2023) outlines commitments to fair wages, safe working conditions, and no forced or child labor. However, the company has faced criticism for opaque supply chain practices. In 2021, the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre flagged concerns about migrant labor conditions in palm oil and mica supply chains, ingredients used in some Estée Lauder products. The company has since joined the Responsible Mica Initiative and RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) to improve sourcing ethics. **Corporate Transparency**: Estée Lauder publishes annual sustainability and social impact reports, detailing progress on diversity, emissions reductions, and responsible sourcing. It received a 'B' grade from the 2023 Fashion Transparency Index for disclosing some supplier lists and audit processes but lacks full traceability for all raw materials. The company has committed to net-zero emissions by 2030 and increased its use of recyclable packaging. **Certifications & Controversies**: While Estée Lauder is not certified by Leaping Bunny or PETA’s cruelty-free program, some of its brands (like Aveda and Smashbox) are Leaping Bunny-approved for markets outside China. The company has faced backlash for 'greenwashing' claims, such as its 2022 'Clean' beauty marketing, which was criticized for lacking standardized definitions. Independent audits by groups like Oxfam have praised Estée Lauder’s gender equity efforts (women hold 50% of senior roles) but called for stronger action on living wages in its supply chain.
