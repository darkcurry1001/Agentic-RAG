  "report": "Korres is a Greek skincare and cosmetics company founded in 1996 by pharmacist George Korres. The company is headquartered in Athens, Greece, with its main offices located at 5 Pentelis Street, 151 26 Marousi, Athens. Korres operates as an independent entity without a separate parent company, meaning it is self-owned and managed. The company has grown significantly since its inception, establishing itself as a well-known brand in natural skincare and beauty products. Korres products are developed using high-quality natural ingredients, many of which are sourced locally in Greece. The company's production facilities are also based in Greece, ensuring close oversight of manufacturing processes and quality control. While Korres does not publicly disclose the exact number of employees, estimates suggest that the company employs between 200 and 500 workers, including staff in production, research and development, marketing, and retail operations. Korres has expanded its presence internationally, with products sold in over 30 countries through partnerships with major retailers, pharmacies, and its own e-commerce platform. The company has also opened flagship stores in key markets, including London and New York. Korres remains privately held, with George Korres and his family maintaining majority ownership. The company has occasionally attracted investment interest, but as of the latest available information, it has not undergone any significant ownership changes or gone public. For verification, Korres' official website (korres.com) provides details about its history, product philosophy, and retail locations. Independent sources such as business databases (e.g., Bloomberg, Orbis) and industry reports confirm the company's headquarters and operational structure. Additionally, news articles and interviews with George Korres highlight the company's commitment to natural ingredients and sustainable practices. Despite its growth, Korres retains a strong connection to its Greek heritage, which is reflected in its branding and product formulations."
