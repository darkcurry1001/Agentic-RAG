      "Answer RAG: Based on the provided context, I can tell you that Beiersdorf conducts animal testing in certain circumstances. According to the text, \"Beiersdorf states on its official website that it does not conduct animal testing for its cosmetic products, except where required by law (e.g., in China, where regulatory authorities may require animal testing for certain products).\" This means that while Beiersdorf does not intentionally test on animals, some of their products may still be subject to animal testing due to local regulations in countries like China.\n",

      "However, it's worth noting that the company is a member of the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA), which indicates its commitment to non-animal research methods. Additionally, Beiersdorf supports the global ban on cosmetic animal testing and emphasizes its commitment to alternative testing methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also mentioned in the context that Beiersdorf is not listed as a certified cruelty-free brand by PETA or the Leaping Bunny program due to its compliance with Chinese regulations. This may be seen as a limitation, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the company conducts animal testing on a large scale.\n",

      "Answer LLM: Beiersdorf, the parent company of brands such as Nivea and Eucerin, has a policy in place regarding animal testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to their website and publicly available information, Beiersdorf is committed to minimizing animal testing whenever possible. They claim to be working towards replacing animal tests with alternative methods, which are considered more humane and reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's worth noting that some of the company's products may still undergo animal testing in specific situations or countries where such testing is required by law or regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few points from Beiersdorf's website regarding their stance on animal testing:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Animal testing only when necessary**: Beiersdorf aims to avoid animal testing whenever possible and only conducts tests when they are legally required, such as for regulatory purposes in certain countries.\n",
      "2. **In-house research using alternative methods**: The company is investing in the development of alternative test methods that can replace or reduce the need for animal testing.\n",
      "3. **Participation in international partnerships**: Beiersdorf participates in various initiatives aimed at reducing animal testing worldwide and promoting the use of more humane, reliable, and efficient testing methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some sources, such as PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), have criticized Beiersdorf's policy on animal testing, stating that some products still undergo animal testing. However, it appears that the company is making efforts to minimize animal testing and move towards alternative methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're concerned about animal testing when purchasing Nivea or Eucerin products, I recommend checking the specific product label for information on its testing status or contacting Beiersdorf's customer service directly for more details.\n",
