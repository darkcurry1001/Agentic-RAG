      "Answer RAG: Based on the provided context, here is a detailed answer regarding Beiersdorf's environmental policies:\n",
      "\n",
      "Beiersdorf has made significant commitments to environmental sustainability through its \"Care Beyond Skin\" strategy. This includes three key areas of focus: Climate Action, Sustainable Packaging, and Responsible Sourcing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Climate Action**: The company has set ambitious climate targets aligned with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). By 2025, Beiersdorf aims to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% compared to a 2018 baseline. Its long-term goal is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. As of 2022, the company has reduced its carbon emissions from operations by 64% since 2018, primarily through energy efficiency measures and renewable energy adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beiersdorf sources 100% renewable electricity for its production sites in Europe and plans to expand this initiative globally. The company's climate efforts have been independently verified by organizations such as CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), which awarded Beiersdorf an \"A-\" score for climate change mitigation in 2022.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Responsible Sourcing**: Beiersdorf adheres to strict sourcing guidelines for raw materials, prioritizing certified sustainable ingredients. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 100% of its palm oil derivatives are RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil)-certified.\n",
      "* The company sources organic shea butter through fair trade partnerships.\n",

      "\n",
      "Independent audits by organizations like Rainforest Alliance verify these claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Water Stewardship**: Beiersdorf has reduced water consumption in its production processes by 35% since 2014, implementing water-saving technologies and recycling systems. The company is a member of the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) and has certified several sites under the AWS Standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Beiersdorf has made significant progress in reducing its environmental impact, it still faces challenges such as the carbon footprint of product transportation and the presence of microplastics in some products. However, the company plans to phase out microplastics by 2025.\n",
