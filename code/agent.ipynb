Despite being a member of the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) and investing in non-animal research methods, some products may still be subject to animal testing in China.\n",

      "However, it's worth noting that Beiersdorf has made efforts to reduce its reliance on animal testing through strict sourcing guidelines for raw materials, prioritizing certified sustainable ingredients, and committing to zero deforestation in its supply chain by 2025. Additionally, the company has been certified cruelty-free by PETA and is a member of several organizations promoting responsible business practices.\n",

      "It's also important to mention that while some Beiersdorf brands are certified as \"cruelty-free,\" this certification only applies to specific markets where animal testing is not required by law. The company's compliance with Chinese regulations means that it may still be subject to animal testing in China, even if its products meet other cruelty-free certifications.\n",

      "\n",
      "Beiersdorf, a multinational personal care company that owns brands such as Nivea, Eucerin, and La Roche-Posay, has committed to reducing animal testing in its product development processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to their official website and statements from the company, Beiersdorf follows a \"3Rs\" approach (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) for animal testing:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Replacement**: Where possible, they use alternative methods, such as in vitro tests or computer simulations, to replace animal experiments.\n",
      "2. **Reduction**: They reduce the number of animals used in testing whenever necessary.\n",
      "3. **Refinement**: When animal testing is unavoidable, Beiersdorf aims to make it more humane and minimize animal suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beiersdorf has also joined various initiatives that promote alternatives to animal testing, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM)\n",
      "* The International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation (ICCR)\n",
