The company emphasizes its commitment to alternative testing methods and supports the global ban on cosmetic animal testing.

Beiersdorf’s commitment to reducing CO2 emissions (aiming for carbon neutrality by 2025) and its use of recyclable packaging are noted as positive steps. **Independent Assessments:** While Beiersdorf is not listed by PETA or Leaping Bunny due to its presence in China, it has received praise for reducing animal testing reliance.

The company has received recognition for its transparency, including a 'B' rating from CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) for climate change disclosure.

      "Beiersdorf does not conduct animal testing for its cosmetic products except where required by law. However, this means that some products may still be subject to animal testing in specific markets, particularly in China, due to regulatory requirements. Although the company has stated its commitment to alternative testing methods and supports a global ban on cosmetic animal testing, it is not listed as a certified cruelty-free brand by PETA or the Leaping Bunny program.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that Beiersdorf is a member of the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA), which reflects its investment in non-animal research methods. This suggests that the company is actively working towards reducing its reliance on animal testing.\n",
