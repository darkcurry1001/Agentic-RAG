      "Answer RAG: Based on the provided context, I can answer your question about whether Beiersdorf conducts animal testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beiersdorf does not conduct animal testing for its cosmetic products except where required by law. However, this means that some products may still be subject to animal testing in specific markets, particularly in China, due to regulatory requirements. Although the company has stated its commitment to alternative testing methods and supports a global ban on cosmetic animal testing, it is not listed as a certified cruelty-free brand by PETA or the Leaping Bunny program.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that Beiersdorf is a member of the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA), which reflects its investment in non-animal research methods. This suggests that the company is actively working towards reducing its reliance on animal testing.\n",

      "\n",
      "Beiersdorf is a member of the Leaping Bunny Program, which is a widely recognized certification program for companies that do not test their products or ingredients on animals. The company also claims to follow the 3Rs principle (Replace, Reduce, Refine) in accordance with international regulations and industry standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's essential to note that while Beiersdorf strives to minimize animal testing, they may still conduct some tests on animals under specific circumstances, such as:\n",

      "2. Scientific validation: Beiersdorf may use animal testing to validate the safety and efficacy of new ingredients or products.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're concerned about animal testing by Beiersdorf, I recommend checking their website for updates on their policies and practices. Additionally, you can look for third-party certifications like the Leaping Bunny logo, which indicates that a company has met certain standards for minimizing animal testing.\n",
